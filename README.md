## Problem Statement
Many people due to a variety of factors can't properly use a keyboard and mouse to properly use computers and other technology.

## Solution
So we will create a software to analyze broad hand gestures as input to a computer system to replace standard peripherals.

## Monetization Strategy
By petitioning the software as a medical device we will get insurance companies to help subsidize the cost rather than using a subscription model.

## Team Names
- Ajemian Beckworth
- Michael McFarlin
